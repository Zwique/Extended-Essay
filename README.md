## 📄 Overview

This repository contains my IB Extended Essay (EE) exploring the limitations of the RSA algorithm with respect to key size and possible methods to overcome these limitations.

In addition to the EE, I am also providing my **Theory of Knowledge (TOK) Essay** as part of the IB Diploma Programme core requirements.

The EE is a **4,000-word independent research project** that involves investigating a topic of personal interest, formulating a focused research question, conducting research, and presenting findings in a formal academic style.

## 📚 Abstract

The RSA algorithm is one of the most widely used public-key cryptosystems, providing the foundation for secure communication over the internet. However, its security heavily depends on the difficulty of factoring large integers, which is directly related to key size. This paper investigates the limitations of RSA regarding key size, analyzing how computational feasibility, efficiency, and security are affected. It further explores approaches to mitigate these issues, including the adoption of stronger key sizes, algorithmic optimizations, and the potential transition to post-quantum cryptography.

## 🎯 Key Findings

- RSA security relies on the complexity of integer factorization, which becomes increasingly vulnerable as computational power grows.  
- Key sizes below 2048 bits are considered insecure; 4096-bit keys offer stronger security but introduce performance and time complexity overheads.
