## 📚 Abstract

The RSA algorithm is one of the most widely used public-key cryptosystems, providing the foundation for secure communication over the internet. However, its security heavily depends on the difficulty of factoring large integers, which is directly related to the key size. This paper investigates the limitations of RSA regarding key size, analyzing how computational feasibility, efficiency, and security are affected. It further explores approaches to mitigate these issues, including the adoption of stronger key sizes, algorithmic optimizations, and the potential transition to post-quantum cryptography.

## 🎯 Key Findings

- RSA security relies on integer factorization complexity, which becomes more vulnerable as computational power increases.
- Key sizes below 2048 bits are considered insecure; 4096-bit keys offer stronger security but introduce performance and time complexity overhead.
